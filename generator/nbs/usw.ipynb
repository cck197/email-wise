      "Dr. Al Sears, M.D. Here's What I Drink Instead   By: Al Sears, MDDear Health-Conscious Reader,It doesn't matter how healthy or thin you are, reaching for a sugary drink is still dangerous for your heart. Four times as dangerous as not drinking one.New research presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association finds that women who drank only two sugary drinks a day were nearly four times as likely to have high triglycerides, the best predictor of heart risk for women.They were also significantly more likely to have impaired blood sugar levels even when not eating or drinking.(1)Sugary drinks increase triglycerides because they are almost pure carbohydrate. Drinking flavored water, sweetened tea, soda, or those dessert-like coffees send a rush of sugar straight into your bloodstream.When your body gets too much of this kind of carbohydrate, it wants to store it as fat. How does it do this? It turns the carbs into triglycerides. Then it transports them through the blood from the liver where they're made to the adipose cells where they're stored.Problem is, even if you're outwardly thin, this fat can accumulate around your organs without you ever knowing it. It's called visceral fat. It causes inflammation, and can lead to the inflammatory diseases diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.And sugary drinks are bad for that reason, but diet drinks may actually be worse...Continue Reading...______________________________________\n",

      "In my last article in this newsletter, I covered the potential health issues related to the synthetic compounds added to most commercial non-dairy milk products. Even though many of these compounds are marketed as \"nutrients\" and listed as \"vitamins\" on the nutrition table, they simply don't behave in your body the same way that real vitamins do, when they are contained in their natural, synergistic state with other nutrients.The potential risks of these synthetic nutrients can range from DNA damage to reproductive toxicity.  And unfortunately, the potential risks of non-dairy milks don't end there.In addition to synthetic nutrients, manufacturers add stabilizers, texture enhancers and other compounds to give liquids that would otherwise be clear, a whitish, milk-like texture.One of these ingredients is guar gum.Guar Gum: A Safe Stabilizer or Digestive Stressor?Made from guar beans, guar gum is a polysaccharide that is commonly used in ice cream and other dairy and dairy-like products to improve the texture. However, guar gum also contains compounds - including phytic acid and lectins - that can cause digestive disturbances.These compounds are actually referred to as \"anti-nutrients,\" because they can adhere to important minerals (including magnesium, calcium, zinc, and iron) and remove them from your body. Lectins are also adhesive molecules that \"stick\" to the lining of the gut and can eventually compromise its integrity.Some people tolerate guar gum without issue. However, others experience a range of digestive complications after consumption.  If you do choose to consume foods that contain guar gum, take note of how you feel after eating them. Another questionable additive that is found in non-dairy milks is carrageenan... \n",

      "Eat to Dream: Study Shows Dietary Nutrients Associated With Certain Sleep Patterns\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are what you eat,\" the saying goes, but is what you eat playing a role in how much you sleep? Sleep, like nutrition and physical activity, is a critical determinant of health and well-being. With the increasing prevalence of obesity and its consequences, sleep researchers have begun to explore the factors that predispose individuals to weight gain and ultimately obesity. Now, a new study from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania shows for the first time that certain nutrients may play an underlying role in short and long sleep duration and that people who report eating a large variety of foods - an indicator of an overall healthy diet - had the healthiest sleep patterns.The new research is published online, ahead-of-print in the journal Appetite.\"Although many of us inherently recognize that there is a relationship between what we eat and how we sleep, there have been very few scientific studies that have explored this connection, especially in a real-world situation,\" said Michael A. Grandner, PhD, instructor in Psychiatry and member of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology at Penn. \" In general, we know that those who report between 7-8 hours of sleep each night are most likely to experience better overall health and well being, so we simply asked the question \"Are there differences in the diet of those who report shorter sleep, longer sleep, or standard sleep patterns?\"To answer this question, the research team analyzed data from the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NHANES includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The sample for the survey is selected to represent the U.S. population of all ages and demographics. For the current study, researchers used the survey question regarding how much sleep each participant reported getting each night to separate the sample into groups of different sleep patterns. Sleep patterns were broken out as \"Very Short'' (<5 h per night), ''Short'' (5-6 h per night), ''Standard' (7-8h per night), and ''Long'' (9 h or more per night). NHANES participants also sat down with specially trained staff who went over, in great detail, a full day's dietary intake. This included everything from the occasional glass of water to complete, detailed records of every part of each meal. With this data, the Penn research team analyzed whether each group differed from the 7-8 hour \"standard\" group on any nutrients and total caloric intake. They also looked at these associations after controlling for overall diet, demographics, socioeconomics, physical activity, obesity, and other factors that could have explained this relationship.The authors found that total caloric intake varied across groups. Short sleepers consumed the most calories, followed by normal sleepers, followed by very short sleepers, followed by long sleepers. Food variety was highest in normal sleepers, and lowest in very short sleepers. Differences across groups were found for many types of nutrients, including proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals.In a statistical analysis, the research team found that there were a number of dietary differences, but these were largely driven by a few key nutrients. They found that very short sleep was associated with less intake of tap water, lycopene (found in red- and orange-colored foods), and total carbohydrates, short sleep was associated with less vitamin C, tap water, selenium (found in nuts, meat and shellfish), and more lutein/zeaxanthin (found in green, leafy vegetables), and long sleep was associated with less intake of theobromine (found in chocolate and tea), dodecanoic acid (a saturated fat) choline (found in eggs and fatty meats), total carbohydrates, and more alcohol.\"Overall, people who sleep 7-8 hours each night differ in terms of their diet, compared to people who sleep less or more. We also found that short and long sleep are associated with lower food variety,\" said Dr. Grandner. \"What we still don't know is if people altered their diets, would they be able to change their overall sleep pattern? This will be an important area to explore going forward as we know that short sleep duration is associated with weight gain and obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Likewise, we know that people who sleep too long also experience negative health consequences. If we can pinpoint the ideal mix of nutrients and calories to promote healthy sleep, the healthcare community has the potential to make a major dent in obesity and other cardiometabolic risk factors.\"Other authors for Penn include Nicholas J. Jackson and Jason R. Gerstner, PhD.\n",

      "I need to lose 15 lbs of fat before my March 21 vacation to get rid of the fat hanging on my belly!  How much cardio should I be doing per week?  My shoulder is hurting, any ideas as to why after looking at the workout I sent you?  Roger\n",
      "________________________________________________ \n",
      "  \n",
      "Roger, I would focus your energy on interval sprints 2-3 times per week in addition to weight training sessions geared specifically for fat loss.  Based on your estimated body fat test of 15%, steady state cardio is a waste of time and can be counterproductive in many cases by increasing stress hormones responsible for belly fat storage. You can train all day and night, but if stress hormones are elevated you will not lose body fat!Are You Going Through the Motions or Pushing your Limits?Many people train just to go through the motions in the gym and this lack of effort will dictate slow progress!  The purpose of the weight training and interval sprint sessions is to drive up the powerful fat burning hormone- growth hormone!  Lactic acid is a precursor to growth hormone and spikes due to tough training sessions which include a combination of short rest periods and high training quality by way of weight load, rep speed and proper form.Method to the Madness Drives Fast Fat LOSSChasing fatigue is not the answer to your fat loss goals.  There must be method to the madness which is why I suggest a customized plan.   The right training routine design will enable you to fight the fatigue curve and produce a higher quality work level with every set.  Manipulating the nervous system plays a key role here through the use of antagonistic super sets.  Continue Reading...\n",

      "Purchasing InformationOrder MinimumsAll orders must weigh at least 7 pounds in order to ship, to ensure everything stays frozen during transit.$75 minimum purchase requirement, since we have built the cost of shipping into the price of each product.You will never be charged extra for shipping.   There is a $7.50 handling fee upon checkout.The South Carolina Chicken Bundles, Olive Oil and cookbooks ship from separate locations, so they are not included in the 7 lb weight minimum.  The shopping cart will keep track and remind you if your order is under the 7 lb limit.   Weight Discount Receive a $25 discount for every 40 pounds you order. This offer excludes items that ship separate such as the South Carolina Chicken and Olive Oil.This is our way of saying thank-you for purchasing in bulk!  This can be any combination of products totaling 40 pounds and does not have to be specific to any category.  Each 40 pound interval will yield the discount - for example, order 80 pounds and we'll take $50 off! Contact InfoNeed to change your address information or remove yourself from our customer newsletter?
