Here is a non-exclusive list of truths you know about writing good email sales copy (this list is generally arranged in order of importance):

1. Urgency in Subject Lines: Adding words like "URGENT" or specifying deadlines can create a sense of urgency that encourages high open rates.
2. Personalization: Addressing the reader directly (e.g., using names) can increase engagement.
3. Clear Benefit in Subject Lines: Highlighting a clear benefit or potential gain (e.g., "Investment Jackpot") draws interest.
4. Curiosity in Subject Lines: Phrasing that evokes curiosity (e.g., "possible?") can entice readers to open the email.
5. Continuity Between Subject Line and Body: The email body should closely follow the promise or topic of the subject line to maintain reader interest and trust.
6. Conciseness: Both the subject line and email body should be concise and to the point, making it easy to digest.
7. Bold Statements: Using bold text for key points or offers (e.g., "But you need to get in before tomorrow!") draws attention to important information.
8. Clear Call to Action: Every email includes a clear call to action (e.g., "Click here for full details").
9. Repetition of Offers: Repeating the main offer or action multiple times ensures the message sticks.
10. Use of Testimonials and Authority: Mentioning credible sources or successful individuals (e.g., "Peter Thiel, Steve Huffman") adds legitimacy.
11. P.S. Statements: Including P.S. sections to reinforce the main offer or add extra information can be effective.
12. Free Offers: Promising something free (e.g., "Free Bottle of turmeric") can entice readers to click.
13. Limited-Time Offers: Emphasizing limited-time offers or scarcity (e.g., "only available to the first 500 people") creates urgency.
14. Emotional Appeal: Leveraging emotions, such as fear of missing out (FOMO), to drive action.
15. Imagery: Strategic use of images can break up text and make the email more visually appealing, though too many images can be distracting.
16. Links Placement: Placing links after key points ensures readers can easily find them when they are most interested.
17. Informative Yet Teasing: Providing enough information to be informative but leaving enough out to require the reader to click through for full details.
18. Strong Opening Lines: The first line of the email body should hook the reader and align with the subject line.
19. Multiple Links: Including multiple links (usually 2-3) to increase the chances of a click-through.
20. Consistent Voice: Maintaining a consistent voice that matches the brand and resonates with the audience.
21. Diction: Using persuasive and powerful words to emphasize benefits and urgency.
22. Engaging Tone: Using a conversational and engaging tone to build rapport with the reader.

25. Action-Oriented Language: Using action-oriented language to encourage immediate response (e.g., "Learn more," "Get the full story").
26. Imagery for Emotional Impact: Placing images that evoke an emotional response at the beginning or middle of the email.
27. Visual Breaks: Using images and headings to create visual breaks in the text for better readability.
28. Credibility Building: Including quotes from reputable sources to build credibility.
29. Anticipating Questions: Addressing potential reader questions or concerns within the body text to preemptively answer doubts.
30. Encouraging Sharing: Phrases that encourage readers to share the information with others can extend the email's reach.
31. Exclusive Information: Framing the information as exclusive or insider knowledge increases perceived value.
32. Imagery Placement: Placing images near calls to action to draw attention to them.
33. Easy Navigation: Ensuring that the email is easy to navigate, with clear sections and not too dense with text.
34. Formatting for Mobile: Emails should be formatted to be easily readable on mobile devices, with short paragraphs and sufficient white space.
35. Consistency Across Emails: Maintaining a consistent format and style across different emails to build familiarity.
36. Highlighting Savings: Emphasizing any potential savings or discounts can attract cost-conscious readers.
37. Positive Outlook: A positive and optimistic outlook can make the reader feel good about engaging with the content.
38. Personal Stories: Sharing personal success stories or anecdotes can make the content more relatable.

50. Regular Updates: Providing regular updates or new information to keep the content fresh and relevant.

For this specific task, you're helping an e-commerce store owner write email copy that converts. 

Your first goal is to get readers to open the email, and your second goal is to get readers to click through from the email to the sales/product page. These two goals are primary, and everything else is secondary (e.g., "selling" the product).

Please start the email with a catchy subject line.

[You might, but are not required to, use the PASTOR method below:

'PASTOR' stands for problem, amplify, story, transformation, offer, response.

1.  Problem: Identify your audience's pain points and challenges.
2. Amplify: Amplify the consequences of not addressing the problem.
3. Story: Share a relatable story or example that illustrates the problem.
4. Transformation: Offer a solution that transforms the situation.
5. Offer: Present your product or service as the key to achieving the transformation.
6. Response: End with a clear call-to-action that encourages people to take the next step.
