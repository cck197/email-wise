      </h3>
      <p>
        <span>11.1 Informal Negotiations.</span>
        <span>
          To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute,
          controversy, or claim related to these Terms and Conditions (each a
          &quot;Dispute&quot; and collectively, the &quot;Disputes&quot;)
          brought by either you or us (individually, a &quot;Party&quot; and
          collectively, the &quot;Parties&quot;), the Parties agree to first
          attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly
          provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before
          initiating the arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon
          written notice from one Party to the other Party.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>11.2 Binding Arbitration.</span>
        <span>
          If a Party is unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
          negotiations, the Disputes (except those Disputes expressly excluded
          below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding
          arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD
          HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration
          shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration
          Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) and,
          where appropriate, the AAA&apos;s Supplementary Procedures for
          Consumer-Related Disputes (&quot;AAA Consumer Rules&quot;), both of
          which are available at the AAA website, www.adr.org. Your arbitration
          fees and your share of arbitration compensation shall be governed by
          the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA
          Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be
          excessive, we will pay all the arbitration fees and expenses. Except
          where otherwise required by the applicable AA rules or applicable law,
          the arbitration can take place in the State of Wyoming. Except as
          otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel
          arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm,
          modify, vacate, or enter judgement on the award entered by the
          arbitrator.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
          arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state
          and federal courts located in the State of Wyoming, and the Parties
          hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal
          jurisdiction, and forum non-conveniens with respect to venue and
          jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any
          way to the Site or the EmailWise Products be commenced more than one
          (1) year after the cause of the action arose. If this provision is
          found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
          arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision
          found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided
          by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed or
          jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
          jurisdiction of that court.

        <span>
          11.1 Exceptions to the Informal Negotiations and Arbitration.
        </span>
        <span>
          The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
          above provision concerning informal negotiations and binding
          arbitration: (a) any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or
          concerning the validity of, and of the intellectual property rights of
          a Party, (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of
          theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any
          claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal
          and unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
          Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
          illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court
          of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed or jurisdiction
          above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
          that court.

          It is your responsibility to abide by local laws in relation to the
          legal usage of the EmailWise Products in your local jurisdiction as
          well as other laws and regulations applicable to you. You must also
          factor -- to the extent of your local laws -- all aspects of taxation,
          the withholding, collection, reporting, and remittance to your
          appropriate tax authorities. ALL USERS OF THE EMAILWISE PRODUCTS
          ACKNOWLEDGE AND DECLARE THAT THEIR FUNDS COME FROM LEGITIMATE SOURCES
          AND DO NOT ORIGINATE FROM ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES; USERS AGREE THAT
          EMAILWISE WILL REQUIRE THEM TO PROVIDE OR OTHERWISE COLLECT THE
          NECESSARY INFORMATION AND MATERIALS AS PER RELEVANT LAWS OR GOVERNMENT
          ORDERS TO VERIFY THE LEGALITY OF THE SOURCES AND USE OF THEIR FUNDS.
          EmailWise maintains a stance of cooperation with law enforcement
          authorities globally and will not hesitate to seize, freeze, terminate
          Users&apos; accounts and funds which are flagged out or investigated

          Either you or EmailWise may terminate or cancel your subscription to
          any EmailWise Products at any time (with respect to any product that
          is subscription-based). You understand and agree that the cancellation
          or termination of your subscription is your sole right and remedy with
          respect to any dispute with us including, without limitation, any
          dispute related to, or arising out of: (i) any terms of these Terms
          and Conditions or our enforcement or application of these Terms and
          Conditions; (ii) any practice or policy of EmailWise, including these
          Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy, or our enforcement or
          application of these policies; (iii) the content available through the
          Site or any change in content provided through the Site or with
          respect to any EmailWise Products; (iv) your ability to access and/or
          use the Site or any EmailWise Product; or (v) the amount or types of
          our fees or charges, surcharges, applicable taxes, or billing methods,
          or any change to our fees or charges, applicable taxes, or billing
          methods. Upon cancellation or termination of your subscription to any
          EmailWise Products, we may immediately deactivate your user account
          and all related information and/or files in your user account and/or
          bar any further access to such information and/or files, the Site (or
          part thereof) and/or EmailWise Products, except as we may otherwise

          You can cancel your subscription by contacting EmailWise or by such
          other means as we may provide from time to time. We will attempt to
          process all cancellation requests within 72 hours after we receive
          your request. If you cancel near the end of your billing period and
          are inadvertently charged for the next period&apos;s fee, contact us
          to have the charges reversed. If you use an EmailWise Product during
          that next period, you will not be entitled to a refund. We reserve the
          right to collect fees, surcharges, or costs incurred before your
          cancellation takes effect.

          Testimonials found on the Site or the EmailWise Products or which are

          guarantee that anyone will achieve the same or similar results.
