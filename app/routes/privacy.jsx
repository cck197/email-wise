      </h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          We are not in the business of selling data, and we take care to allow
          your personal information to be accessed only by persons or entities
          that require access to perform their tasks and duties. In addition, we
          share only with third parties who have a legitimate purpose for

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            Third party service providers: We employ other companies and
            individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
            analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments,
            and transmitting content/emails. These third-party service providers
            have access to the personal information needed to perform their
            functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must
            process the personal information only as permitted by applicable

            generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains
            subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy
            (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). In the event that
            EmailWise or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user
            information will be one of the transferred assets.

            apply our Terms; or protect the rights, property or safety of

          Security and privacy is of utmost importance to us, and we work to
          protect the security of your personal information during transmission
          by using encryption protocols and software.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>

          We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of
          your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or
          access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server.
          All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure
          Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment
          gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized
          with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep
          the information confidential.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          However, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized
          acquisition, or alteration of your data will not occur. Please
          recognize that you play a vital role in protecting your own personal
          information. When registering with any EmailWise Products, it is
          important to choose a password of sufficient length and complexity, to
          not reveal this password to any third-parties, and to immediately
          notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of
          your account.

      </p>
      <p>

          Furthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or
          confidentiality of information you transmit to us or receive from us
          by internet or wireless connection, including email, phone, or SMS,
          since we have no way of protecting that information once it leaves and
          until it reaches us. If you have reason to believe that your data is
          no longer secure, please contact us.

          We do not knowingly request or collect personal information from any
          person under the age of 18. If a user submitting personal information
          is suspected of being younger than 18 years of age, EmailWise will not
          allow the user to continue using the EmailWise Products. We will also
          take steps to delete the information as soon as possible. Please
          notify us if you know of any individuals under the age of 18 using our
          Services so we can take action to prevent access to the EmailWise

        <span>9. Legal Bases for Collecting Personal Information</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span>
          The EU GDPR and UK data protection laws require a legal basis for our
          use of personal information. Our basis varies depending on the
          specific purpose for which we use personal information. We rely on:
        </span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            Performance of a contract when we provide you with products or
            services, or communicate with you about them. This includes when we
            use your personal information to take and handle orders or to
            process payments.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Our legitimate business interests and the interests of our users
            when we detect and prevent fraud and abuse in order to protect the
            security of our users, ourselves, or others.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Your consent when we ask for your consent to process your personal
            information for a specific purpose that we communicate to you. When
            you consent to our processing your personal information for a
            specified purpose, you may withdraw your consent at any time and we
            will stop processing of your data for that purpose.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Compliance with a legal obligation when we use your personal
            information to comply with laws. For instance, we collect bank
            account information for identity verification purposes.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            These and other legal bases depending on the purpose for which we
            use personal information.

          The recipients of this information use it to develop and deliver
          targeted advertising on our websites and on the websites of third
          parties. The information is used only for marketing purposes. It is
          not used to make targeted offers that are priced differently based on
          estimated purchase ability. The targeted advertising resulting from
          this information sharing is related to common product and service
          categories, such as magazines, subscriptions, weight-loss programs,
          supplements, books, events, online summits, and similar categories
          that you see advertised routinely. These advertisements are not based
          on data relating to adult content, individual or aggregate health
          information or records, or information relating to your financial
          accounts. We use cookies to facilitate the sharing of this information
          while you are online. Information in these cookies is updated from

          these cookies are encrypted. At this time we do not respond to

          of advertisements on the sites you visit (including sites such as
          Facebook and Google) for a variety of reasons. In the same way that we
          use information about you to customize or personalize the content or
          services we provide, we may also use information to make the ads you
          see more relevant for you, and more effective for advertisers. We may
          also use information from other companies or sites to assist in
          determining the effectiveness of advertising. In some cases, the ads
          shown to you are based on your activity on our sites or on other sites
          or information appended from offline sources. This is often called
          targeted advertising, behavioral targeting, interest-based

          may receive a &quot;cookie&quot; or other technology that helps us

          information is then used to help us display ads that are more
          relevant, both on our sites and on other sites (including the Google
          Ad Network, Facebook, Twitter, and other ad networks and social
          platforms). Note that the information shared with advertising networks
          is always with a unique identifier, and does not include personally
          identifiable information such as your name, email address, etc. For
          example, we use Google to serve advertisements on our websites, which
          use the Google Doubleclick cookie, and in some cases, a unique device
          identifier, to show you ads based on your visit to our websites and
          other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the Google
          Doubleclick cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network
          privacy policy (https://adssettings.google.com/). Your access to our
          websites should not be affected if you do not accept cookies served by
