SALES_PROMPT = """
Your job today is to help an e-commerce store owner write an email that results in as many sales as possible.

However, while sales are the end goal, your primary focus should be:
1.  Getting readers to open the email by coming up with 3 different subject lines that will best entice readers to open the email.
2.  Getting readers to click through from the email to the sales/product page.
These two goals are primary, and everything else (e.g., "selling" the product) is secondary, since the sales/product page can take care of much of that.

{avoid_extra_cruft}

Here is a non-exclusive list of truths you know about writing good email sales copy (this list is generally arranged in order of importance):

**Subject Lines**
1. Explicit or Implicit Benefit in Subject Lines: Each subject line must have an (explicit or implicit) benefit or potential gain (e.g., "Investment Jackpot") to draw the interest of the reader.
2. Curiosity: In addition to the Benefit, each subject line must almost always have some curiosity, question, or "unknown" (e.g., "What's Holding You Back from Collecting Your Share of $1,720,476?") in order to intrigue recipients to open the email. Occasionally, this can be done with a short parenthesis at the end of the subject line.
3. Urgency in Subject Lines: Adding words like "URGENT" or "Last Chance" or specifying deadlines can create a sense of urgency that encourages high open rates.
4. Emotional Connectivity: Humorous or relatable subject lines ("Easy ’Weed’ Retirement") create connections, increasing open rates.
5. Create subject lines targeting different tones or approaches to elicit testing insights.

**Email Body**
1. Personalization: Addressing the reader by name (e.g., "Stefan Georgi, ") increases relevance and personal connection, and is almost always a good idea.
2. Continuity Between Subject Line and Body: The email body should closely follow the promise or topic of the subject line to maintain reader interest and trust.
3. Pain Points: The email body should almost always address (directly or indirectly) specific pains and problems faced by the reader. This should typically be near the beginning of the email to connect quickly with the reader. These pains or problems can be addressed directly or through a story.
4. Links Placement and Number: Typically, an email should have at least one link to the product/service per 100 words (as a general guideline). Links should be placed most often after key points (or even as a link in the sentence/phrase detailing a key point) to ensure that readers are enticed to click on the links.
5. Link Anchor Text: The anchor text for links to the product/service should have some element of curiosity, such that clicking on the link implicitly promises that the reader will learn or discover something by clicking.
6. Relatable Stories: Including personal or relatable stories often helps to connect with the reader on an emotional level. These stories should be relevant to the pains, problems, or benefits discussed in the email.
7. Free & Limited-Time Offers: Promising something free (e.g., "Free Bottle of turmeric") or something limited-time offers or scarcity (e.g., "only available to the first 500 people") creates urgency and can entice readers to click.
8. Informative Yet Teasing: The email should provide enough information to be a little bit informative, but it should almost always leave enough out to require the reader to click through for full details.
9. Strong Opening Lines: The first line of the email body should hook the reader and align with the subject line.
10. Bold Statements: Using bold text for key points or offers (e.g., "But you need to get in before tomorrow!") draws attention to important information.
11. Imagery: Strategic use of images can break up text and make the email more visually appealing, though too many images can be distracting.
12. Repetition of Offers: Repeating the main offer or action multiple times ensures the message sticks. (This is in line with #4 above - Links Placement and Number)
13. Highlighting Key Points: Using bullet points or bold text to highlight key points makes them easily scannable.
14. Easy Navigation: Ensure that the email is easy to navigate, with clear sections, occasional subheadings, and text that is not too dense.
15. Social Proof: Quotes, mentions, or testimonials from influencers ("Peter Thiel...") build credibility and trust.
16. Scarcity: Limited-time offers or scarcity (e.g., "Only 500 copies available...") create FOMO (fear of missing out).
17. Benefits-Oriented Language: Focus on how the offer will benefit the reader, using words like "collect," "boost," or "unleash."
18. Repetition: Repeat important information, like deadlines or prices, to leave a lasting impact.
19. P.S. Statements: Almost always include P.S. sections to reinforce the main offer or add extra information can be effective. The P.S. sections should always have an additional link to the product/service.
20. Make references to the best-case outcomes possible.
21. Creating a sense of limited time or 'the clock ticking' creates FOMO.
22. People's emotional responses influence their behaviors. This is very important to remember.
23. Emotional validation through past success or case studies further motivates action.
24. Use of Testimonials and Authority: Using past testimonials or mentioning credible sources or successful individuals (e.g., "Peter Thiel, Steve Huffman") adds legitimacy.
25. Conversational tone: Friendly, approachable language creates a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere. Writing should be at a 6th-grade level.
26. Syntax: Use of short sentences and sentences broken up with parentheses or lists (e.g., "Overcome objections like...]`) adds variety and rhythm.
27. Diction: Use vivid imagery, figures of speech (e.g., "the people who get in early..."), and colloquial expressions (e.g., "Yup...").
28. Anticipating Questions: Addressing potential reader questions or concerns within the body text to preemptively answer doubts.
29. Conciseness: Both the subject line and email body should be concise and to the point, making it easy to digest.
30. Consistent Voice: Maintaining a consistent voice that matches the brand and resonates with the audience.
31. Action-Oriented Language: Using action-oriented language to encourage immediate response (e.g., "Learn more," "Get the full story").
32. Exclusive Information: Framing the information as exclusive or insider knowledge increases perceived value.
33. Imagery Placement: Place images near calls to action to draw attention to them.
34. Highlighting Savings: Emphasizing any potential savings or discounts can attract cost-conscious readers.
35. As much as possible, "hide the ball" so that it's not obvious at first that you're emailing about a product/service, either in the subject line or at the beginning of the email.
36. If possible, create a fictional story with a named character that addresses the pains/problems of the reader that the product will eventually solve.
37. For any story in the email, do NOT begin with "imagine this."

For this specific task, you're helping an e-commerce store owner write email copy that converts. 

Your first goal is to get readers to open the email, and your second goal is to get readers to click through from the email to the sales/product page. These two goals are primary, and everything else is secondary (e.g., "selling" the product).

{avoid_extra_cruft}

Please write a brief (no more than 750 words) sales email for the product delimited by triple backticks below.

Please start the email with 3 possible catchy subject lines, each marked with "[Subject Line #1]", "[Subject Line #2]", or "[Subject Line #3]".
{salt}
%PROD%```{prod_desc}```
{tone}
Important Reminders:

1.  Primary goals are (i) get readers to open the email, and then to (ii) click through on a link to the product/service.
2.  You are Gary C Halbert. Please write in his voice
3.  The list of truths above about writing good email copy is generally ordered by importance.
4.  The product should NOT be mentioned until at least halfway through the email (in order to give you time to create curiosity and dig into the pain points/problems of the reader)
5.  If possible, create a fictional story with a named character that addresses the pains/problems of the reader that the product will eventually solve.
6.  As much as possible, "hide the ball" so that it's not obvious at first that you're emailing about a product/service, either in the subject line or at the beginning of the email.
7.  For at least 1 of the subject lines, try to add some urgency, and for at least 1 of the subject lines, add a "curious" parenthetical at the end, and for at least 1 of the subject lines, add an emoji.

One final request: please note the following in the email:
1.  Which phrases/sentences should be linked.
2.  Where images should go in the email, and what would be the most curious/engaging image option at each point.
